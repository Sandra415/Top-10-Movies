				<h1 class="posttitle">Poppy</h1>

				<p>Three thousand years ago, gardeners were growing oriental poppies and their Papaver cousins around the world. Oriental poppy plants (Papaver orientale) have remained a garden favorite ever since. Once planted, they require no special care and will last for many years. Their original vibrant red-orange color is still the most popular for growing, though oriental poppies come in a variety of colors that will match or blend any garden’s color scheme. How to Care for Oriental Poppies When asked how to care for oriental poppies, the rules are few. Careful placement is essential. Once planted, these beauties don’t like to move. Don’t plant them in soggy ground. They hate wet feet. Do fertilize them, but only once a year. Do plant them with favorites whose growth habits will cover the garden bald spots when your poppies go dormant in the heat. Oriental poppies relish the cool temperatures of early spring and fall. Their bright blossoms open just as most spring bulbs are finished and before the summer flowers begin. <p>How to care for oriental poppies includes allowing them to die back: Many novice gardeners have killed their oriental poppy plants through misdirected concern. In the heat of summer, they water, water, water, in an effort to save their dying plant. In the end, the excess water is what kills them. When is the Best Time to Plant Oriental Poppies? Before we talk about when is the best time to plant oriental poppies, let’s talk a bit about their life cycle. New growth begins in the fall when temperatures are cool and getting colder; new shoots sprout from the sleeping roots. Foliage unfurls until it forms a mound. This mound of green will stay there through the winter. It won’t grow much, but it won’t die, either. In spring, the growth begins again and the clump sends up long stems of bright flowers. By July and August, the heat is too much for the delicate foliage. Oriental poppies are supposed to go dormant in midsummer. In fall, when the weather cools, they come back stronger than before. The clumps will become larger each year, but will never be invasive. So, based on their growth habits, spring and fall answers the question of when is the best time to plant oriental poppies and the rule of green-thumb is spring where the winters are cold and fall where the winters are warm.</p>
				<p> Growing Oriental Poppies: When talking about how to grow oriental poppy, we should begin with propagation. Nurseries rarely carry potted oriental poppy plants because they are difficult to transplant. Once sown, they do not like to be disturbed. Therefore, the easiest method for how to grow oriental poppies is to sow the seeds directly into the ground. Select a site that gets plenty of sun — at least six hours a day – and turn over the top inch or two of soil. Poppies aren’t particular about their soil, but they are fussy about drainage. If the drainage is poor, amend the soil with a couple of inches of compost before you plant. Sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil. Do not cover them. Oriental poppies need light to germinate. Water the area regularly, keeping it moist but not soggy until the seeds germinate, which should take about two weeks. When the seedlings are about one inch tall, thin them to 6 inches apart.</p>

			<h1 class="posttitle">Sunflower</h1>
			<img src="http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4vc3u35Ah1rrj3pro1_500.gif" class="postimage">
			<p>Sunflower is a highly valued crop used for oil, ground meal and seeds. It's one of the few crops that actually originated in North America. Sunflower is an annual plant and a heavy feeder that loves the sun. There are many varieties, ranging in height from very small to over 15 feet. Yellow, orange, burgundy or red are the most popular colors although there are others.</p>

			<p>Sunflowers are hardy plants that can grow with minimal care, but they do require some tending. In order to grow healthy sunflowers you need three basic components--soil, sun, and water.</p>

			<p>TIP: Our expert gardening advisor, Susan Patterson suggests, "Sow sunflower seeds directly into the garden rather than starting them in pots. Plant 5 or 6 seeds in a clump 8 inches apart and thin to 2 plants when they are 12 inches tall. Select the strongest plant when they reach 2 feet tall.</p>

			<p>Soil:
			Sunflowers can grow in nearly any type of soil, as long as it is well-drained. They can be planted in rocky soil, fertile soil and mixed medium soil. For the best results, provide your sunflowers with enough space to establish a thick root system and enough space to grow tall stocks. Don't plant your sunflowers too close together, as this can cause root strangle which will inhibit their ability to grow normally and to produce seeds. Work a slow release fertilizer that contains trace minerals into the soil.</p>

			<p>TIP: Susan advises, "Add well-aged manure, rabbit, horse or cow into the soil before planting sunflowers." </p>

			<p>Sun:
			When growing sunflower, ensure they get enough sun. Sunflowers need 6 to 8 hours of full sun daily. They do the best in full sun, however, gardens that have partial sun can also produce healthy sunflowers, they may just not reach their full height potential. Don't plant your sunflowers in shady spots, as this will stunt their growth and limit their ability to produce sunflower seeds.</p>

			<p>Water and Feed:
			Water new plants thoroughly.</p>

			<p>TIP: Susan adds, "Water sunflowers 3 to 4 inches away from the plant to ensure that you get the root zone. Do not put fertilizer directly on the stem."
			For larger plants, dig a moat all the way around, 18 inches from the plant, and 3 inches deep. Pour several gallons of diluted organic fertilizer into the moat weekly.</p>

			<p>TIP: "Watch the weather carefully and always be prepared to offer additional support to sunflowers in the event of strong winds." </p>

			<h1 class="posttitle">Cacti</h1>
			<img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1d3b51ac1c922e6103ef4d8361f3fdb2/tumblr_oojnr9x4hO1ut0cp5o1_500.gif" class="postimage">
			<p>Potted Plants:
			In most cases cactus will do well in pots as long as you remember three things. Food, light, water.

			Food:
			When you bring the plant home most of the time it is in a small pot and it probably has grown there for a long time, which means it has used up most of all the nutrients in the soil. So think about repotting and setting up feeding program. Most cactus like several small feeding, better than one large feeding. I like a time release type in the spring and this will feed the plant for six or more months. The other way is to give the plants food three time a year (spring, summer, fall)with a dilute solution of plant food like (5-10-5). This should do them well for the year.

			</p>
			<p>Light:
			A potted cactus will live and flower in the house if given enough light, place the plant near a bright lighted window, where it will receive light most of the day. On the patio is different place the cactus in a partly shaded area until it become accustom to the sun. Never bring the cactus home and place it in the bright sun, cactus sun burn just like people.

			Water:
			Cactus in pots require more care in watering than in the ground. In the growing period which can be spring and summer or fall and winter. Depending on where they come from, south america or north america, the plant should not be allowed to go completely dry, just moist. In the house watering could be as little as once a month depending on the dryness of the house. But outside as much as every two or three days. Take a wooden pencil or dow rod and place it down through the soil to the bottom of the pot, when removed, if damp soil is on it don't water. After a few try's you will learn when to water.</p>
